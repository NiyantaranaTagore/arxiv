# --- Model Configuration ---
# Model for generating sentence embeddings.
# Recommended: 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for a good balance of speed and accuracy.
# Other options: 'paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2', 'all-mpnet-base-v2'
embedding_model: 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'

# --- Similarity Analysis Hyperparameters ---
# The similarity function to use. 'cosine' is standard for comparing embeddings.
similarity_function: 'cosine'

# The threshold for considering two sentences as similar.
# Value should be between 0 and 1. A higher value means stricter similarity.
similarity_threshold: 0.10

# --- Corpus Source Configuration ---
# Set to true to fetch the corpus dynamically from arXiv.org.
# If false, the local 'corpus_dir' will be used.
