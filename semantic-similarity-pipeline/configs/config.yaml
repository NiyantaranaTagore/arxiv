# --- File Paths ---
# Path to the input PDF document you want to analyze.
input_doc_path: "data/input/2502.02587v1.pdf"

# Directory where the output PDF report will be saved.
output_dir: "data/output/"

# Directory containing the corpus of PDF documents to compare against.
corpus_dir: "data/corpus/"

# --- Model Configuration ---
# Model for generating sentence embeddings.
# Recommended: 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for a good balance of speed and accuracy.
# Other options: 'paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2', 'all-mpnet-base-v2'
embedding_model: 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'

# --- Similarity Analysis Hyperparameters ---
# The similarity function to use. 'cosine' is standard for comparing embeddings.
similarity_function: 'cosine'

# The threshold for considering two sentences as similar.
# Value should be between 0 and 1. A higher value means stricter similarity.
similarity_threshold: 0.10

# --- Corpus Source Configuration ---
# Set to true to fetch the corpus dynamically from arXiv.org.
# If false, the local 'corpus_dir' will be used.
use_arxiv_corpus: true

# The maximum number of relevant papers to fetch from arXiv for analysis.
# The arXiv API sorts by relevance, so the first few results are the most important.
# Increasing this number will slow down the analysis but provide a more comprehensive comparison.
max_arxiv_results: 100

# --- Report Generation ---
# Title for the generated report.
report_title: "Semantic Similarity Analysis Report"

# Font sizes for the report.
